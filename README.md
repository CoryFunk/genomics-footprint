# DNAse footprints pipeline, database generation, and transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction
This directory contains workflows and scripts used to generate footprints, database, and candidate TFBS.

- [generate_footprints](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_footprints) - TBD

- [generate_db](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_db) - The generate_db directory shows a step-by-step procedure along with the processing code to intersect hint or wellington] footprints output with the FIMO database and put the results in a database.

- [TFBS_prediction](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/TFBS_prediction) - TBD
