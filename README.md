# DNAse footprinting workflow, transcription factor motifs, and footprint database generation

This directory contains workflows and scripts used to generate footprints, database, and candidate TFBS.

- [generate_footprints](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_footprints) - This generate_footprints provide an instruction for how to run the DNAse footprinting workflow and include a demo snapshot.

- [generate_motif](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_motif) - This generate_motif directory is a guideline if one needs to create transcription factor motifs. The motif file is used for annotating  the footprints.

- [generate_db](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_db) - The generate_db directory shows a step-by-step procedure along with the processing code to intersect hint or wellington] footprints output with the FIMO database and put the results in a database.
